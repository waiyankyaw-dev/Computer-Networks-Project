## ⚠️ Warning

Please note that if you **fork** this repository, the new repository will be **Public** by default.

- **Risk:** Any code you push to a public fork is visible to other students.
- **Responsibility:** To avoid potential plagiarism, you are responsible for ensuring your own code remains **Private** until the end of the semester. We recommend creating a private repository for your own development instead.

## 📖 Introduction

Before you begin, you should read the following two documents:

- [**Main document**](docs/CS305-Fall2025-Project-Main.md) : Describes the core logic, goals, technical specifications, and grading policy.
- [**Setup tutorial**](docs/CS305-Setup-tutorial.md) : Includes environment setup, the code skeleton, using the simulator, and a full step-by-step example.

## ❓ Getting Help

**Start your project as early as possible so you have more time to communicate with the TAs if you find issues.** The TAs may not be able to respond to your questions immediately, especially as the end of the semester approaches.

To ensure all students can benefit from questions and answers, you can submit project-related questions as [**issues in this repository**](https://github.com/OctCarp/sustech-cs305-f25-project-starter/issues) . For some easy-to-answer small and common questions, you can also try to raise them in the GitHub [**repository discussions**](https://github.com/OctCarp/sustech-cs305-f25-project-starter/discussions).

- **Before posting:** Please search existing (both open and closed) issues to see if your question has already been answered.
- **When posting:** Provide a clear title, a description of the problem, and steps to reproduce it if possible.

**Note:** We will only answer questions related to the project. General questions (such as: What is the TCP ACK mechanism?) will not be answered.
