## ⚠️ Warning

Please note that if you **fork** this repository, the new repository will be **Public** by default.

- **Risk:** Any code you push to a public fork is visible to other students.
- **Responsibility:** To avoid potential plagiarism, you are responsible for ensuring your own code remains **Private** until the end of the semester. We recommend creating a private repository for your own development instead.

## 📖 Introduction

Before you begin, you should read the following two documents:

- [**Main document**](docs/CS305-Fall2025-Project-Main.md) : Describes the core logic, goals, technical specifications, and grading policy.
- [**Setup tutorial**](docs/CS305-Setup-tutorial.md) : Includes environment setup, the code skeleton, using the simulator, and a full step-by-step example.

## 📢 Important Updates

- **[2025-11-03]** We release the CS305 2025 Fall Project.

These are the important updates. For full information, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) .
